                                property fordoes itself / And leads the will to desperate undertakings'. He believes Hamlet is sick with love for his daughter and intends to report this to the king.

                                'Hamlet’s transformation’ and find out why he is behaving strangely. Polonius enters and shares his view with Claudius and Gertrude that Hamlet has been driven to madness because of his love for Ophelia. Polonius reads
                                from a letter that Hamlet sent his daughter: 'Doubt that the stars are fire, / Doubt that the sun doth move, / Doubt truth to be a liar, / But never doubt I love'. Polonius suggests the king and queen spy on Hamlet as he
                                talks to him. Hamlet speaks in riddles, suggesting that he is mad, though his speech also contains hidden meanings which Polonius picks up on. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern enter and Hamlet reveals that he knows they were
                                sent to spy on him. They announce that the ‘tragedians of the city’ are arriving to cheer Hamlet up. The travelling players arrive and Hamlet asks them to perform a moving speech from ‘Hecuba and Priam’. He then asks them
                                to perform 'The Murder of Gonzago' for the king and his guests the following evening. Before they leave he gets their permission for him to write a 12 line speech that he wants to be included in the play. Alone, he praises
                                the actor who delivered the speech for connecting to his true emotions when performing and criticises himself for being unable to express his inner feelings.

                                Rosencrantz and Guildenstern report to Claudius, telling him that they don’t know why Hamlet is behaving strangely. Claudius then arranges a meeting between Hamlet and Ophelia so that he and Polonius can hide and watch them. They believe this will confirm
                                whether Hamlet is sick with love or not. Before this, Hamlet delivers a soliloquy talking about his own existence and delivering his famous speech beginning ‘To be, or not to be, that is the question’. When Ophelia enters,
                                Hamlet confuses her with mixed messages. One moment he says 'I did love you once', the next 'I loved you not'. He goes on to insult Ophelia and tells her to go to a nunnery to repent her sins. Ophelia doesn't understand
                                the way he treats her and can't believe she 'sucked the honey of his music vows' in the past. Having seen all of this, Claudius decides that Hamlet is not in love with Ophelia and believes 'what he spake, though it lacked
                                for a little, was not like madness'.

                                Hamlet talks to the actors before they perform. He wants the play to 'hold a mirror up to nature' as the plot is very similar to the events leading up to his father’s death. Hamlet instructs Horatio to observe Claudius’ response to the play to see if
                                he shows any guilt. The performance begins by depicting a happily married king and queen but the player king becomes sick and worries that his queen may marry again. Another actor enters and poisons the player king. Hamlet
                                announces that this man plots to marry the dead king’s wife and, at this moment, Claudius rises in fury and calls for 'light' before storming out of the performance. Queen Gertrude follows him. Hamlet and Horatio take this
                                reaction as proof that the ghost was telling the truth and Claudius killed his brother. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern summon Hamlet to talk to his mother and he snaps at them, declaring that he has known all along that they
                                were spying on him. Alone, Hamlet talks about revenge and says ‘now could I drink hot blood / And do such bitter business as the day / Would quake to look on'.

                                Hamlet visits his mother in her closet and threatens her. Polonius is spying on them from behind an <span class="anno" title="A rich tapestry or screen, used as cover to get dressed behind.">arras</span> and when Gertrude
                                screams, Polonius makes a noise. Hamlet is shocked and stabs through the arras with a knife. He is surprised when he pulls back the screen to see the dead body of Polonius. Hamlet’s fury builds as he confesses his disgust
                                at his mother’s recent marriage. The ghost of his father appears and tells him not to be so harsh on Gertrude. Gertrude either can’t see the spirit or pretends not to. Hamlet demands that his mother changes her ways and
                                that she doesn’t tell Claudius about their meeting. He also reveals that he knows about the plan for Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to take him to England and tells her he has to go. Hamlet leaves the closet, pulling the
                                corpse of Polonius with him. Gertrude then tells Claudius that Hamlet is ‘Mad as the seas and wind when both contend / Which is the mightier’ and has killed the ‘good old man’ Polonius. She tells him Hamlet has gone ‘to
                                draw apart the body he hath killed’, and taken the body away.

                                Ophelia visits the queen, who does not want to see her but eventually she agrees. Ophelia sings songs and when Claudius comes in he and Gertrude agree that Ophelia is sick and he says that ‘this is the poison of deep grief: it springs / All from her father’s

                                Horatio and is shocked to see the bones of dead people being treated so badly. One of the gravediggers shows Hamlet the skull of a court jester. Hamlet is taken aback saying ‘Alas poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow
                                of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy'. Hamlet then contemplates how we all turn to dust in the end. The scene is interrupted by the royal family and Laertes entering the graveyard to bury Ophelia. An argument takes
                                place between Laertes and Hamlet when Hamlet leaps into the grave and says 'I loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothers / Could not -- with all their quantity of love -- / Make up my sum’ and they fight. Hamlet leaves and

                                then choose their weapons and Laertes takes the sword with a poisoned tip. After they have started, Claudius drinks to Hamlet’s health before dropping a poisoned pearl into the cup and offering it to Hamlet. Hamlet doesn’t
                                drink it but during the fight Gertrude drinks the wine from the poisoned cup. Claudius tries to stop her saying ‘Gertrude, do not drink’ but it’s too late and Gertrude slowly dies. The fight continues and both men end up
                                swapping swords. They are both wounded with the deadly poison. Laertes falls first and warns Hamlet ‘thou art slain’ and that ‘the king, the king’s to blame’. In a fit of rage, Hamlet forces Claudius to drink the poisoned
                                wine and ‘Follow my mother’. Before Laertes dies, he and Hamlet forgive each other. Hamlet then asks Horatio to tell his story to others and predicts that Fortinbras will become King of Denmark. He utters his final breath,
                                saying ‘The rest is silence. O, o, o, o!’. Fortinbras enters with his army, celebrating the fact they have claimed the land in Poland and ambassadors also arrive from England saying Rosencrantz and Guildenstern have been
                                killed. Horatio promises to explain the chaos. Fortinbras is moved by Hamlet’s story and orders a soldier’s burial for the dead prince.

                                        <p>Look at how the gravediggers speak to each other and to Hamlet in Scene 1. These characters are often called ‘clowns' and the way they speak is very light-hearted, with jokes and songs. Why do you think Shakespeare
                                            included humour in the final act of this tragedy? Particularly in a scene where Hamlet talks about death and then sees Ophelia’s funeral?</p>

                                        <p>Notice the way Hamlet behaves in the final scenes, accepting Laertes’ challenge, avenging his mother’s death and reconciling with Laertes. Why do you think some people consider Hamlet a ‘hero’? Would you agree that
                                            he is a heroic figure?</p>

                                        <p>In Act 5 we see the tragic conclusion of the play – Hamlet accepts Laertes’ challenge and is poisoned during the fight. Laertes, Claudius and Gertrude also all die. The only central character left alive at the end
                                            of the play is Horatio and Hamlet asks him, as he dies, to ‘tell my story’. Why do you think Shakespeare leaves Horatio alive? Why do you think the final lines of the play are delivered by Fortinbras? Are there
                                            any parallels you can draw between Fortinbras and Hamlet?</p>
